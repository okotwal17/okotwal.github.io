            <h2>Phase 1: React Learning & Mini Projects (Feb 1 - March 10)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Week 1:</strong> Build a Todo List App while learning React fundamentals, including JSX, components, and state management.
                    <p>During Week 1, I learned the importance of structuring components and managing their states effectively. Working on the Todo List App helped me grasp concepts like handling user input with controlled components, updating states dynamically, and implementing conditional rendering. I also practiced styling components to improve the overall look of the app.</p>

                        <strong>Week 3:</strong> Create a Gym App that incorporates complex state management and improves UI/UX understanding.
                        <p>During Week 3, I worked on developing a Gym App that helped me understand more advanced state management techniques in React. This project required handling multiple user interactions, managing complex state updates, and ensuring a smooth UI experience. I also experimented with Tailwind CSS for styling, which allowed me to rapidly prototype and refine the app’s appearance.</p>

                    <strong>Week 4:</strong> Work on a Machine Learning App, integrating basic ML concepts with React to explore AI-driven web apps.
                    <p>During Week 4, I explored integrating basic machine learning concepts with React. At the start of the week, I researched and experimented with different ML models suitable for web applications, setting up a foundational structure for the project.</p>

                    <p>As the week progressed, I implemented a basic ML model into the app, experimented with data preprocessing techniques, and worked on presenting predictions interactively. I learned about model inference in the browser, optimizing performance, and handling asynchronous tasks efficiently in React.</p>
