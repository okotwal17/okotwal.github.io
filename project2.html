        <h2>MVP Description:</h2>
        <p>Our goal was to boost our github, resume, and make ourselves look professional to future employers. For our MVP, we wanted to start with a few mini projects to learn React, an important and frequently used framework in the workplace. Afterwords, we used our knowledge of React to make a professional portfolio to show to future employers. Lastly, we are going to make a professional Python Web Scraping Bot project to demonstrate my practical skills, problem-solving ability, and initiative, making me a more attractive candidate to CS employers.</p>

            <h2>Phase 1: React Learning & Mini Projects (Feb 1 - March 10)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Week 1:</strong> Build a Todo List App while learning React fundamentals, including JSX, components, and state management.
                    <p>During Week 1, I learned the importance of structuring components and managing their states effectively. Working on the Todo List App helped me grasp concepts like handling user input with controlled components, updating states dynamically, and implementing conditional rendering. I also practiced styling components to improve the overall look of the app.</p>

                    <strong>Week 2:</strong> Develop a NASA App that fetches real-time space data using APIs, enhancing API integration skills.
                    <p>During Week 2, I worked on developing a NASA App that fetches real-time space data using the NASA API. This project helped me learn about API integration, fetching data, and displaying it in a dynamic and user-friendly way.</p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Week 3:</strong> Create a Gym App that incorporates complex state management and improves UI/UX understanding.
                    <p>During Week 3, I worked on developing a Gym App that helped me understand more advanced state management techniques in React. This project required handling multiple user interactions, managing complex state updates, and ensuring a smooth UI experience. I also experimented with Tailwind CSS for styling, which allowed me to rapidly prototype and refine the appâ€™s appearance.</p>

                    <strong>Week 4:</strong> Work on a Machine Learning App, integrating basic ML concepts with React to explore AI-driven web apps.
                    <p>During Week 4, I explored integrating basic machine learning concepts with React. At the start of the week, I researched and experimented with different ML models suitable for web applications, setting up a foundational structure for the project.</p>

                    <p>As the week progressed, I implemented a basic ML model into the app, experimented with data preprocessing techniques, and worked on presenting predictions interactively. I learned about model inference in the browser, optimizing performance, and handling asynchronous tasks efficiently in React.</p>

<section class="section-card"><h2>Web Scraper Bot</h2>
        <h4>The goal is to have the bot scrape two websites, say BestBuy and Amazon, and compare prices of a goods. If the price of the good is cheaper on one website vs another, it will send the user an email to notify them to buy it so that they can resell on the other site. </h4>
<ul>
    <li>Week 1: We built some starter code <a href="https://github.com/okotwal17/PythonWebScrapper">here</a>. We are researching the different technologies and what the next steps with the technologies would be.</li>
<li>Week 2: We built code that the user enters what they want to look for and then it gives them various offers on the product from multiple websites. For the coming weeks, we want to fix a bug where some of the websites don't work, and we might build a simple UI. New Github is <a href="https://github.com/okotwal17/Tech-Deal-Finder">here</a>. Based on how this project is going so far, I think we should plan on just making a basic UI instead of having the user being sent an email. I also think that it should take the user to the website where they can buy the cheapest item so that they can get it as soon as possible.

    <li>Week 3: This week, I have made a very, very basic UI that works only on VSCode. This may be the only restriction on our project. Going forward, I will try to polish this UI in addition to making sure our functionality is fully completed. </li>
    <li>Week 4: I have made an amazing frontend using React, and the backend is with Flask and Python. There are some really cool animations and features. The github can be found <a href="https://github.com/okotwal17/TechDealsScraper">here</a></li>
